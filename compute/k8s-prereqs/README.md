## Dependencies

Several modules require a KUBECONFIG file, in a predefined path, generated by the `eks-ec2` step.

This unfortunately requires `apply`'ing `eks-ec2` before being even being able to evaluate the state of this step.

It is possible to apply only the specific resource that creates the KUBECONFIG file:

```bash
pushd ../eks-ec2
terragrunt apply -target=module.eks_heptio.local_file.kubeconfig
popd
```
