# infrastructure-modules

Terraform modules for infrastructure

Containers to run this: https://hub.docker.com/u/dfdsdk

## Terraform Best Practices

### Terraform Files

- main.tf
- outputs.tf
- vars.tf

### Terraform Module Folder Structure

We recommend a folder structure for Terraform modules like so:

```
module-category
 └ module-name
    └ README.md
    └ main.tf
    └ outputs.tf
    └ vars.tf
```

Example:
```
security
 └ iam-account-alias
    └ README.md
    └ main.tf
    └ outputs.tf
    └ vars.tf
 └ org-account
    └ README.md
    └ main.tf
    └ outputs.tf
    └ vars.tf
network
 └ ...
```

## Release process

Branch protection is not enabled on this repo. Instead we rely on release tags to ensure we do not commit straight to production.

When creating a new release, it's important to ensure only the intended changes are included, not changes others may have committed to *master* without also creating a release.

Before creating the release, you should compare the commit you want to release against the latest release, and ensure only intended changes are included.

In this example, I am comparing the lastest release (**0.1.35**) against the commit I plan to release (**75bec8f**).

### Pre-Commit Hooks (Optional)

This repo defines Git pre-commit hooks intended for use with pre-commit.

Install pre-commit. E.g. brew install pre-commit. https://pre-commit.com/#install
Run pre-commit install in the repo.
That’s it! Now every time you commit a code change (.tf file), the hooks in the hooks: config will execute.

### Credits

The general structure of these modules, file layout etc. are largely based on Gruntwork's recommendations. More specifically the blog posts:

* [Gruntwork blog: How to manage Terraform state](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa)
* [Gruntwork blog: How to create reusable infrastructure with Terraform modules](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d)
* [Gruntwork blog: How to use Terraform as a team](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-use-terraform-as-a-team-251bc1104973)

Gruntwork's example repos, of both modules and live/input data, along with their README files have also proven very useful:

* [Github: gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example)
