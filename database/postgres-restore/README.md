# Terraform aws rds postgres restore module

This module is designed to restore a backed up database based on an existing snapshot with the recommended settings like ssl.
The module will utilize the snapshot and overwrite infrastructure parameters like ports, disk size and most importantly master password.

The connection strings, passwords etc can be found in parameter store in the same account/region as the database.

## Input requirements (Values are only for examples)

* db_name = "papp" (Destructive if changed)
* aws_region = "eu-central-1" (Destructive if changed)
* db_snapshot = "application-postgres-final-prod" (After initial setup this input is ignored)
* application = "application" (Destrutive if changed)
* db_master_username = "test" (Destrutive if changed)
* db_master_password = "<REDACTED>" (Can be used for changing password)
* skip_final_snapshot = false (Optional and should NOT be set to true for production)
